# Predicting-the-Attention-Rate-of-Patients-by-Monitoring-their-Emotions-
In this project a deep research was carried out to understand the most common behavioral 
emotions illustrated by different patients. The decision to choose a Convolutional Neural 
Network for implementation was basically because it is widely known for recognizing image 
patterns and learning from images to predict your outcome which in our case is emotions. 
The model building involved a lot of experimenting with the parameters and the depths of the 
convolutional and hidden layers. Moreover, callback functions were used to save the widely 
information from epochs for visualizations. A bit of enhanced research yielded dad that pre 
trained models provided by PyTorch library we're also great for image recognition hands 
hence the use of pre trained VGG 16 was implied on our data set from stop. After comparing 
the performance of both the models built the custom CNN model yielded better performance 
with an accuracy of 63%. Lastly by using computer vision techniques the recognition of 
emotions was carried out in real time by using default computer camera.
